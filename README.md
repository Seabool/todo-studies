# ToDo Studies

>An application supporting the planning of events, keeping notes and files for studies in one place.

## What is this


It is an application that helps students keep their photos of notes and files in one place. I am writing it to use the knowledge I learned during my studies and because I simply miss such an application.

## Set up

To use this app you will need `javaFX`. If you have it, then you can simply compile it and run.
